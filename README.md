## how it works

opens an email, scans the subject and body for rejection signals — formal stuff like "we regret to inform" but also slang like "straight up denied" or "weren't goated enough". if it smells like a rejection, it fires.

when it detects one:
- big red rejected stamp hits the center of your screen
- faaaah plays
- stay strong card slides up
- chill guy music plays after

---

## notes

- everything stays local, nothing is sent anywhere
- click the extension icon to see your rejection count and clear it
- if you open the same rejection email multiple times, it counts each time. that's intentional

*good luck out there.*
